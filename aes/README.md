# Introduction
The Rijndael algorithm, known as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), is a symmetric block cipher developed by Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. It was selected as the standard encryption technique for the US government and is widely used in securing sensitive data worldwide. The AES uses a symmetric key system, meaning that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This makes it faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption methods, which require two different keys. The strength of AES encryption is determined by the key size, with 128-bit keys being suitable for securing information classified as SECRET and 192 or 256-bit keys being required for TOP SECRET data. Despite its high level of security, the AES algorithm is based on relatively simple mathematical operations, making it efficient and fast to implement in software and hardware.
